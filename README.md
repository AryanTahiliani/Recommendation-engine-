# Recommendation-engine-
A simple and practical Recommendation System built in Google Colab.
This project explores how to suggest items to users based on similarity, preferences, or past interactions.

 What it does:

1. Reads a dataset (e.g., movies, products, or user ratings)

2. Cleans and preprocesses the data

3. Builds and evaluates a recommendation model using techniques such as:

4. Collaborative Filtering (user–item similarity)

5. Content-Based Filtering (feature similarity)

6. Hybrid approach combining both

 Tech stack:

A. Python 3

B. Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

What you’ll learn:

1. How recommendation engines work under the hood

2. Practical data-prep and similarity-calculation steps

3. Ways to measure recommendation quality
